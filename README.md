# Delete link telegrambot

This Telegram bot deletes all messages sent by users who are not chat administrators that contain links. 
The URL-Detector library from LinkedIn is used to recognize messages with links.

Link to library: [URL-Detector](https://github.com/linkedin/URL-Detector/)

_Note from library: Keep in mind that for security purposes, it's better to overdetect urls and check more against blacklists than to not detect a url that was submitted. As such, some things that we detect might not be urls but somewhat look like urls. Also, instead of complying with RFC 3986 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt), we try to detect based on browser behavior, optimizing detection for urls that are visitable through the address bar of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari._

_Note to bot: Users can't send code snippets because dot-notation will be detected as url  

Following texts will be detected as valid url and messages containing them will be deleted:
* '''http://www.gilliman.com'''
* ''"http://www.gilliman.com"''
* @@http://www.gilliman.com"''
* www.google.com
* google.com

__3 Download the project from [GitHub](https://github.com) and unzip it into the necessary folder.__

__4 In the command line, go to the directory with the unzipped project. You should be in a folder with the docker-compose.yaml file.__

__5 Insert your data instead of \<BOT NAME> and \<BOT TOKEN> into the command:__
```bash
docker compose run -e “BOT_NAME=<BOT NAME>” -e “BOT_TOKEN=<BOT TOKEN>” delete-link-service python console.py__
```
Run command in the directory with the unzipped project
```bash
example command:

docker compose run  -e "BOT_NAME=somebot" -e "BOT_TOKEN=6025044839:AAHlPLJzljjDQ2ggr1qhsBAldQCJe3SnhJI" delete-link-service python console.py
```

__7 Delete link bot logs will be saved in file:__
```bash
<path_to_directory>/delete-link-bot/dlb-log-win/dlb.log
```
